<h1 style="font-size:200%; text-align:center; color: darkblue;" ><b><u> UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</u></b></h1>

<p>The UAE overlooks the Arabian Gulf and borders the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the South and West and the Sultanate of Oman to the Southeast.
The UAE has a warm and sunny weather most of the year, recording an ideal temperature from October to May.
The Emirati Dirham is the official national currency. The US dollar is exchanged for the UAE Dirham at a rate of 3.67, and credit cards are widely accepted.
The UAE hosts large foreign communities and all residents enjoy freedom of civil rights and practice of religion.
Arabic is the official language and English is widely spoken in public, markets and restaurants.
The UAE time is 4 hours ahead of GMT.<p>
<p>Historically the domain of individual Arab clans and families, the region now comprising the emirates also has been influenced by Persian culture owing to its close proximity to Iran, and its porous maritime borders have for centuries invited migrants and traders from elsewhere. In the 18th century, Portugal and the Netherlands extended their holdings in the region but retreated with the growth of British naval power there; following a series of truces with Britain in the 19th century, the emirates united to form the Trucial States (also called Trucial Oman or the Trucial Sheikhdoms). The states gained autonomy following World War II (1939–45), when the trucial states of Bahrain and Qatar declared independent statehood. The rest were formally united in 1971, with the city of Abu Dhabi serving as the capital. The stability of the federation has since been tested by rivalries between the families governing the larger states of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, though external events such as the Persian Gulf War (1990–91) and an ongoing territorial dispute with Iran have served to strengthen the emirates’ political cohesion.<p>
